# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration for various tools and applications I use on a daily basis. These configurations are tailored to my preferences and workflows, making it easier to set up a new environment with the same setup.

Use at your own risk. These configurations are specific to my setup and may not work as expected in other environments. Modify and adapt them according to your needs.
